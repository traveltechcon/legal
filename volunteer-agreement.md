# Volunteer Agreement

The whole Travel Tech Con (legal name First Frontier LLC) consists of volunteers. All of us, including founders Marina and Maksim, work on TTC projects without being paid for it. But we couldn't do all the great things we've already done without people that put in their time and creativity into it. We appreciate your contribution greatly!

We act as a non-profit and we're planning to obtain the 501(c)(3) status in the near future. In the meantime, we have to ensure that our relationship with volunteers, including founders, has a sound legal ground, therefore we created this agreement that aims to protect the TTC organization and the volunteers as well.

You (the "Volunteer" or "you"), and Travel Tech Con, legal name First Frontier LLC, 1025 Alameda De Las Pulgas #642, Belmont CA 94002 ("TTC", "we" or "us"), agree as follows.

1. You agree to donate services to TTC in the capacity that you define yourself, as our organization is very loosely organized, therefore our volunteers have to perform multiple different roles at the same time.
2. It is mutually and expressly understood that volunteer services shall be donated, and that you are not entitled to nor expect any present or future salary, wages, or other benefits for these voluntary services.
3. You agree that you will not be considered to be TTC employee, for any purposes other than tort claims and injury compensation, while performing the above described voluntary services.
4. You further understand that if you are responsible for injuries to third parties or damages to their property while acting outside the scope of your volunteer duties, you may be held personally liable for any monetary damages a court may award to the injured party.
5. It is further understood and agreed to by Volunteer that the services rendered to TTC shall apply only in the case of liability arising out of the ordinary negligence that occurs during the scope of the volunteerâ€™s services agreed to herein, and that in no way do any of these provisions apply for the benefit of volunteer, his/her heirs, executors or administrators in any action arising out of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or any other conduct on the part of said volunteer, which cause or may give rise to criminal liability.
6. You further agree that you will fully cooperate with TTC and its agents in any investigation, lawsuit, arbitration, or any other legal or quasilegal proceedings that arise from the matters covered by this agreement. You further agree to notify TTC immediately of any incident that occurs or may occur within your knowledge, which gives rise to liability on your part.
7. You understand that this agreement takes effect immediately when you start performing services for TTC or when you accept an invitation to one of the web-based tools that we use (including, but not limited to Slack, Trello, Eventbrite, Squarespace, traveltechcon.com email, etc.)
8. In consideration with your volunteer engagement, you also give TTC the unrestricted right and permission to use, re-use, publish, republish and monetize content in which creation you participated without restriction as to changes or transformations. You hereby relinquish any right that you may have to creation of the above content. You hereby release, discharge and agree to save harmless TTC, our designees, legal representatives, and all persons functioning under TTC permission or authority, or those for whom TTC is functioning, from any liability by virtue of any publication thereof, including without limitation any claims for libel or invasion of privacy.
9. This agreement may be terminated at any time by either party.

By entering this agreement you affirm that you are over the age of majority and have the right to contract in your own name. You have read the above authorization, release and agreement, prior to its execution. You fully understand the contents thereof.
